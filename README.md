# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## Our Goal

In this project, I dived more into Dart programming concepts and learned how to use open source Flutter packages. 
By the end of this project, I became comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What you I created

I made a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
